# Android Voice Access


## Getting started

On Android, speech input is provided through Google's Voice Access application, which accepts spoken commands to control your Android device.

Voice Access can be switched on in *Settings > Accessibility > Voice Access*, or you can also start it by saying:
  > Hey Google, start Voice Access

There's also a built-in tutorial to get you started.

Once switched on, Voice Access can then be activated by tapping the Voice Access notification in the Notification shade, tapping the Voice Access app icon, or by saying:
  > Hey Google, Voice Access

You can then give it spoken commands.
