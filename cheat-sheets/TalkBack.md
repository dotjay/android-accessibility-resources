# Android TalkBack


## Enable TalkBack

1. Enable the "Volume key shortcut" in Accessibility Settings
2. Set the shortcut service to TalkBack
3. Press and hold both volume buttons for 3 seconds to suspend/resume

Notes:
* The "Volume key shortcut" is also called the "Accessibility Shortcut".
* On older versions of Android, the TalkBack shortcut involved holding down the power button until a dialog appeared, then holding two fingers down on the touch screen.

## Context menus

Context menus provide access to many powerful features and can be displayed as a circle or a list. The circle mode is similar to VoiceOver's Rotor dial on iOS.

Gesture                 | Action
------------------------|-----------------------
*Swipe down then right* | Global context menu
*Swipe up then right*   | Local context menu

The global context menu provides access to commands and shortcuts that may be useful at any time:
- Quick navigation
- Read from top
- Read from next item
- Spell last utterance
- Repeat last utterance
- TalkBack settings
- Text-to-speech settings
- Dim / Brighten screen

The local context menu provides access to commands that are relevant to the current item or screen. It can be used to:
- Switch navigation modes – paragraphs, lines, words, characters, etc.
- Access control-specific actions (or any custom accessibility actions)
- Access links within paragraphs
- Give fine control over slider values


## Customising gestures

You can customise the TalkBack commands performed for these different gestures in *Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack > Settings > Gestures*.
